Okay so for the site layout, I want it to go home page, with get started button -- to a site with teh plans shown, with a button for order now, then -- to a checkout page where they can signup and enter their credit card in. Also there will be an already registered? button allowing them to login to an existing account. At the very bottom will be an order button to finalize everything and submit the payment and start the docker container

AFTER MAKING IT WORK
--------

It now has register, login, and can seperate the servers from each account. so user 1's server is not accesible for user 2 and vice versa.

It may not be best way to do it but it works for now. Currently it has them login twice, once for my website and once for stripe to take their money.

I also made it so every page has a navigation to it by using a navbar.html and base.html template

Admin page is not browseable


Start and stop functions no longer work. attempt 6 or 7 has a good save state of it working
