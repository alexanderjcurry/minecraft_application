so doesnt this require them to login/signup twice since they are doing it once to access my page and once to pay stripe? thats not a normal way to do it right?

You're correct; typically, users shouldn't have to log in twice â€” once for your site and once for Stripe. The process should be streamlined for a better user experience. Here's how you can adjust the flow:

User Chooses a Subscription Plan:

User visits your site and selects a Minecraft server plan to rent.
Check User Authentication:

If the user is not logged in when they choose a plan, redirect them to your login/register page.
If they are already logged in, proceed directly to the payment process.
User Login or Registration:

On the login/register page, users either sign into their existing account or create a new one.
Once logged in or registered, they are redirected back to the plan selection or directly to the payment process (Stripe Checkout).
Stripe Checkout Session:

After logging in and choosing a plan, the user is directed to Stripe's checkout session for payment.
Importantly, this checkout session is tied to the user's account on your site. This means you should create a record in your database linking the Stripe session ID to the user's ID on your site.
Payment and Checkout Session Completion:

The user completes the payment on Stripe's hosted checkout page.
Upon successful payment, Stripe sends a webhook event to your server.
Webhook Processing:

Your server receives the webhook event and uses the session ID to find the corresponding user in your database.
The server then provisions a new Minecraft server and links it to the user's account.
Access to the User Dashboard:

After the payment and server setup, the user can see and manage their Minecraft server(s) on their dashboard on your site.
Server Management:

On the dashboard, the user can start, stop, and configure their server(s) as per their plan.
In this flow, the user only logs in once to your site. Stripe handles the payment separately but doesn't require an additional login. The key is to maintain a link between the Stripe checkout session and the user's account on your system, allowing you to know which user has paid for a server when you receive a webhook event from Stripe.
